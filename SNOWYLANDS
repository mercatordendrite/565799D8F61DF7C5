    Consequences of the Fall on the Communication between Man and the
    Spiritual World—Effects of the Flood—Wizards of Pharaoh—Text in
    Exodus against Witches—The word Witch is by some said to mean
    merely Poisoner—Or if in the Holy Text it also means a Divineress,
    she must, at any rate, have been a Character very different to be
    identified with it—The original, Chasaph, said to mean a person
    who dealt in Poisons, often a Traffic of those who dealt with
    familiar Spirits—But different from the European Witch of the
    Middle Ages—Thus a Witch is not accessary to the Temptation of
    Job—The Witch of the Hebrews probably did not rank higher than a
    Divining Woman—Yet it was a Crime deserving the Doom of Death,
    since it inferred the disowning of Jehovah’s Supremacy—Other Texts
    of Scripture, in like manner, refer to something corresponding more
    with a Fortune-teller or Divining Woman than what is now called a
    Witch—Example of the Witch of Endor—Account of her Meeting with
    Saul—Supposed by some a mere Impostor—By others, a Sorceress
    powerful enough to raise the Spirit of the Prophet by her own
    Art—Difficulties attending both Positions—A middle Course adopted,
    supposing that, as in the Case of Balak, the Almighty had, by
    Exertion of His Will, substituted Samuel, or a good Spirit in his
    Character, for the Deception which the Witch intended to
    produce—Resumption of the Argument, showing that the Witch of Endor
    signified something very different from the modern Ideas of
    Witchcraft—The Witches mentioned in the New Testament are not less
    different from modern Ideas than those of the Books of Moses, nor do
    they appear to have possessed the Power ascribed to
    Magicians—Articles of Faith which we may gather from Scripture on
    this point—That there might be certain Powers permitted by the
    Almighty to Inferior, and even Evil Spirits, is possible; and in
    some sense the Gods of the Heathens might be accounted Demons—More
    frequently, and in a general sense, they were but logs of wood,
    without sense or power of any kind, and their worship founded on
    imposture—Opinion that the Oracles were silenced at the Nativity
    adopted by Milton—Cases of Demoniacs—The Incarnate Possessions
    probably ceased at the same time as the intervention of
    Miracles—Opinion of the Catholics—Result, that witchcraft, as the
    Word is interpreted in  the Middle Ages, neither occurs under the
    Mosaic or Gospel Dispensation—It arose in the Ignorant Period, when
    the Christians considered the Gods of the Mahommedan or Heathen
    Nations as Fiends, and their Priests as Conjurers or
    Wizards—Instance as to the Saracens, and among the Northern
    Europeans yet unconverted—The Gods of Mexico and Peru explained on
    the same system—Also the Powahs of North America—Opinion of
    Mather—Gibb, a supposed Warlock, persecuted by the other
    Dissenters—Conclusion.
